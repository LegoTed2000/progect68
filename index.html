    <h1>Amaroo School</h1>
    <center>
      <p>Amaroo School was designed to cater for children from Kindergarten to Year 10. The first section of the school
        was
        opened on 19 May 2004 by Ms Katy Gallager, MLA and Minister for Education, Youth and Family Services. Our first
        intake of 154 students, in 2004, included those from Kindergarten to Year 5. This was extended to Year 8 in 2005
        with Year 9 students starting in 2006 and Year 10 students in 2007. Since the incorporation of the Preschool in
        2008, Amaroo School has operated as a Preschool to Year 10 school and presently has 1971 students.
